    "# Recommender Systems - Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, recommender systems (RS) are all around us, directing (helping?) us to make our decisions on whether we buy that shirt, listen to Aerosmith or Coldplay or even suggesting past diseases diagnosis giving a patient's condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main factor that brought the due attention to this was probably the internet. Due to the flood of information we suffer today on media sources and advertisements, people have a lot of struggle to find, or even define, what they want. On the other hand, this amount of data allowed scientist to create plataforms who would analyse all of this and would try to bring only the necessary information that a user would like in a short span of time. This is only a basic, defition of a RS. We can dig a litlle deeper and evaluate other possible ways we can recommend itens to a person and we will end up with the main existing fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Non-personalised and Stereotyped**: The most basic system. It doesn't evaluate other people's individual opinion, but use summary statistcs from the overall population.  \n",
    "* **Content Based**: Takes into consideration what a person likes and, given the characteristics of the existing itens, it recommends the most probable itens the user would like.  \n",
    "* **Collaborative**: Takes into consideration what a person likes and also what other similar people like. In this way, we can give recommendations as, as you and person P likes itens A,B and C, and person P have liked item D also, you could like item D as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "This first notebook is going to be about the first system, Non personalised and Stereotyped recommendations.\n",

    "# Non Personalised Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic way to provide recommendations is a non-personalised one. Non-personalised recommendations don't take user's individual preferences nor context into consideration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take for instance a newly create client at Amazon. He wouldn't have bough any item on the marketplace, so Amazon doesn't know what the particular tastes of this new person are, so the best way to start with any possible recommendation that the new customer could like is what other clients, regardless of any their individual tastes, had also bought.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Stereotyped Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "One little improvement we can make still on the domain of non-personalised recommendations is to do crude sterotype divisions on the metrics. Basic ratings per sex, city or economical status are some examples of categories in can easily create and can improve the recommendation quality if we believe there are really distinct products who are directed for each of these segments.\n",

    "The most basic way to provide recommendations is a non-personalised one. Non-personalised recommendations don't take user's individual preferences nor context into consideration. \n",
    "Take for instance a newly create client at Amazon. He wouldn't have bough any item on the marketplace, so Amazon doesn't know what are the particular tastes of this new person, so the best way to start with any possible recommendation which the new customer would like are what other clients, regardless of any their individual tastes, are buying.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendations are always based on a score, which can be calculated from basic metrics, such as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Explicit metrics: Evaluations given directly by the customer, *i.e.*, ratings, overall score, likes, etc.\n",
    "* Implicit metrics: Implict user behaviour, such as clicks, view, time spent, etc.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Each of these types of metrics comes with pros and cons. **Explicit metrics** are good because we directly ask the user about what he thinks. However, some questions/problems arise:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Question: Do de users know how to really reflect their tastes on a one number final metric?\n",
    "* Problem: Users ratings varies between each other. Some people rate a movie 5 stars when it was like he expected, others have this bar at 3 stars and only give a 5 stars rating when the movie surpass all his expectations.\n",
    "* Problem: Users ratings varies over time. If a user watch the same movie months after he watched for the first time, his evaluation can change.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are talking about **Implicit Metrics**, we assume that the user's actions speak more than its own words. Besides, collecting behaviour data is faster and without the human judgment that can affect the explicit metrics. But it also comes with some subtleties that we have to concern about:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Dealing with a one number summary is easier to work than with multiple variables. If you're tracking multiple data, such as number of clicks, views and time, we have to come up with a way to average them, giving the proper weights, and this weights of course change between domains.  \n",

Used by companies such as Amazon, previously by Netflix and TripAdvisor, these companies use these evaluations in order to trace a profile between people and their products, using non-personalised and personalised recommendations.\n",

    "There is a lot of discussions on whether this type of evaluation if effective or not. Lots of notes and references written below were extracted from the first course on [Coursera's Recommender System Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/learn/recommender-systems-introduction/home/info), more specifically on the last week of the first course, an interview with Martijn Willeman on [Psychology of Preference & Rating](https://www.coursera.org/learn/recommender-systems-introduction/lecture/ch4oV/psychology-of-preference-rating-interview-with-martijn-willemsen)\n",

    "Ranking by symbols date from the 19th century, where [Mariana Starke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_(classification)#History), in her 1820's guidebook, used exclamations points to rate works of art of specific value. My guess is, by some marketing play, people made an effort to translate the symbols to stars, an image that transmits more 'richness' by its shiny interpretation and its abstract relatioship to diamonds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After the readoption of the 5 start ratings, popularised again by Netflix and Uber, lots of companies started to use this form of quality evaluation. The difficulties start when the scale is not properly set. Of course we have boundaries for it (5 points in a whole start review and 10 points in a half star scale review), but we aren't usually provided concrete references on which to base ourselves next time we rate something. This scenario brings instability to ratings distributions and it is made worse because of our human perception, that tends to review it based on instantenous (on the fly) evaluations.\n",
