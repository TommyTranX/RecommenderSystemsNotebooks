    "The pearson correlation coefficient comes from the covariance factor between two variables normalised to have a bounded value between 0 and 1 and answers the following question: **How much linear correlated** the variables $x$ and $y$ are? As the values are normalised, its possible to have some guidelines for the coefficient value, such as:\n",

    "* Exactly 1. A perfect uphill (positive) linear relationship\n",
    "* 0.70. A strong uphill (positive) linear relationship\n",
    "* 0.50. A moderate uphill (positive) linear relationship\n",
    "* 0.30. A weak uphill (positive) linear relationship\n",
    "* 0 no **linear** relationship, neither positive nor negative\n",
    "* The same for negative values\n",

    "The value comes from dividing the covariance between variables $x$ and $y$ and dividing it by the product of $x$ and $y$ standard deviations:\n",

    "    - Differently from the 1 variable standard deviation = square root of the variance, we don't take square roots from the covariance values, as it is still not easily understandable. For example, the covariance output would be in the unit $x^{2}y^{2}$ and taking the square root would still be on the unit $xy$. Instead of finding a a proper valid unit transformation, people tend to go directly to a unitless variable, the correlation.\n",
